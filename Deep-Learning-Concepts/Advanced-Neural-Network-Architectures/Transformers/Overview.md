In GPT, there is **no cross-attention layer** because there is no encoder. The cross-attention layer is specifically used to attend to encoder outputs, which are not present in models like GPT that rely solely on the decoder for autoregressive generation. Therefore, GPT consists of **masked self-attention** and **feed-forward** layers only.

Autoregressive generation refers to a process in which a model generates a sequence (such as text) one element (or token) at a time, where each token is predicted based on the previously generated tokens. The term autoregressive means that each step in the generation process depends on the outputs of the previous steps.

### Steps in Autoregressive Text Generation:

1.  **Initial Input (Prompt)**:
    
    -   You provide an initial prompt, which could be a few words or sentences. This prompt serves as the context for the generation process.
2.  **Token Prediction**:
    
    -   GPT takes the prompt as input and predicts the most likely next token (e.g., word or subword). The model does this using a combination of its learned weights and the context provided by the input.
    -   The model leverages **masked self-attention**, meaning it can only attend to previous tokens, not future ones, ensuring that it predicts the next token based solely on what has been generated so far.
3.  **Iteration**:
    
    -   After predicting the next token, the model appends it to the input sequence and uses this extended sequence to predict the next token.
    -   This process continues iteratively, with the model predicting one token at a time, based on all previous tokens.
4.  **Stopping Condition**:
    
    -   The generation process continues until a stopping condition is met, such as reaching a certain length or generating a special "end-of-sequence" token.


### Example of GPT Autoregressive Text Generation:

Let’s walk through an example step-by-step, using the following initial prompt:

**Prompt**: "The sun was setting over the mountains, and"

#### Step 1: First Token Prediction

-   Input: "The sun was setting over the mountains, and"
-   GPT looks at the prompt and predicts the most likely next token.
-   **Prediction**: "the" (since "the" is a common word after "and").

#### Step 2: Append the Predicted Token

-   The model now adds the predicted token "the" to the input and uses the updated sequence to predict the next token.
-   Updated Input: "The sun was setting over the mountains, and the"

#### Step 3: Second Token Prediction

-   Input: "The sun was setting over the mountains, and the"
-   GPT predicts the next token, which could be a noun or adjective that commonly follows "the".
-   **Prediction**: "sky"

#### Step 4: Append the Predicted Token

-   The predicted token "sky" is appended to the input.
-   Updated Input: "The sun was setting over the mountains, and the sky"

#### Step 5: Third Token Prediction

-   Input: "The sun was setting over the mountains, and the sky"
-   GPT predicts the next token based on the extended sequence.
-   **Prediction**: "turned" (a verb that fits well with the context of "sky").

#### Step 6: Continue the Process

-   The process repeats: the predicted token "turned" is added to the sequence, and GPT continues predicting the next token.
-   Updated Input: "The sun was setting over the mountains, and the sky turned"

The model would continue in this fashion, generating more tokens one at a time, producing a coherent and contextually relevant sequence based on the prompt and the prior tokens.

你提到的情况在日常生活中非常常见——我们在说话时，可能会意识到自己犯了错误，然后及时进行更正。这种自我纠正的行为是人类交流的一个重要特征。然而，GPT等模型在生成文本时，**并不会像人类一样主动回过头去更改已经生成的部分**。一旦生成了某个词或短语，GPT就会继续基于这些已经生成的内容生成下一个词，而不会像人类一样在中途发现错误并做出修改。

### 为什么GPT不会自我更正？

1.  **自回归生成机制**：
    
    -   GPT使用的是**自回归（autoregressive）生成**，这意味着它生成每个词时，都是基于之前生成的词。这个过程是单向的，生成的内容一旦生成，就被固定下来，后续的生成会基于这个固定的上下文继续向前推进。
    -   由于模型并没有反向修改的能力，它无法像人类一样实时发现错误并进行更正。
2.  **因果自注意力机制**：
    
    -   GPT中的注意力机制是**因果（causal）自注意力**，这意味着模型只能“看到”之前生成的内容，而不能“看到”未来或尚未生成的内容。
    -   这使得模型在生成过程中是顺序性的，无法回头修改已经生成的词或句子。

### 人类语言中的自我纠正 vs GPT的生成

-   **人类语言的自我纠正**：在人类对话中，当我们意识到我们说错了时，会主动纠正自己。例如：
    
    -   你可能说：“我昨天去超市买了……哦，不对，我是去了书店。”
    -   这种行为源于人类具有即时反馈和反思的能力，我们可以识别到错误，并通过语言表达即时修正。
-   **GPT的固定生成过程**：相比之下，GPT是基于已经生成的部分进行下一步预测的。它不会像人类那样“意识到”自己说错了，也不会主动回过头去修正。它的生成是顺序性的、不可修改的。例如：
    
    -   GPT生成了：“猫坐在椅子上”，接下来它只能继续基于这个句子生成，无法返回去把“椅子”改成“桌子”。

### Example of the Encoder Process

Consider the following sentence as an input sequence:

**Input Sentence**: "The cat sits on the mat."

The encoder will process this sentence through several steps:

### Step 1: **Tokenization**

The input sentence is first tokenized, meaning each word is broken down into individual tokens (or subword tokens). For simplicity, we assume the tokenizer breaks the sentence into word-level tokens:

**Tokens**: `["The", "cat", "sits", "on", "the", "mat", "."]`

### Step 2: **Embedding**

Before processing the tokens, each token is converted into a **vector** using an **embedding layer**. This embedding layer maps each word or token to a fixed-size vector (typically 512 or 768 dimensions) that represents the word in a continuous, high-dimensional space.

For example, the word "cat" might be converted to a vector like this (simplified for illustration):
```python
"The"  -> [0.2, 0.1, 0.7, ...]  # (vector representation)
"cat"  -> [0.6, 0.4, 0.3, ...]
"sits" -> [0.5, 0.9, 0.2, ...]
"on"   -> [0.3, 0.7, 0.1, ...]
"the"  -> [0.2, 0.1, 0.7, ...]
"mat"  -> [0.4, 0.6, 0.8, ...]
"."    -> [0.1, 0.3, 0.4, ...]
```
This vectorized representation of the words (called **word embeddings**) is used as input to the encoder. These embeddings contain semantic information about each word but are not yet contextualized with respect to the rest of the sentence.

### Step 3: **Positional Encoding**

Since Transformers do not have built-in sequence awareness (they don't have a mechanism like RNNs to process tokens sequentially), **positional encoding** is added to the word embeddings to introduce information about the order of the words in the sentence.

Positional encoding adds a unique vector to each token's embedding based on its position in the sequence (e.g., the 1st word gets a different positional vector than the 2nd word). This allows the model to understand the relative positions of words.

### Step 4: **Self-Attention Mechanism**

Once the embeddings (with positional encodings) are passed into the encoder, the **self-attention** mechanism begins its work. This mechanism allows each word to "look at" all the other words in the sentence and assign different levels of attention (importance) to them.

For example, while encoding the word "cat", the self-attention layer may decide that "sits" and "mat" are more important than "The" and "." for understanding the context of "cat". So the self-attention mechanism will combine information from these words to create a contextualized representation for "cat".

-   **Attention Weights for "cat"**:
    -   "The" -> 0.1 (low importance)
    -   "cat" -> 0.3
    -   "sits" -> 0.4 (high importance)
    -   "on" -> 0.1
    -   "the" -> 0.05
    -   "mat" -> 0.35 (high importance)
    -   "." -> 0.1

The self-attention mechanism is applied to each word in the sentence, creating a new representation for every word that takes into account its relationship with the other words.

### Step 5: **Feed-Forward Network**

After self-attention, the new, contextualized word representations are passed through a **feed-forward neural network (FFN)**. This network refines the word representations further and applies non-linear transformations to help the model capture more complex patterns.

The same FFN is applied independently to each word's representation.

### Step 6: **Output of the Encoder (Contextual Representation)**

At the end of this process, each word in the input sentence has a **contextualized representation**. These representations encode not only the meaning of the individual words but also the relationships between the words in the sentence.

For example, the new representation for "cat" now contains information about "sits" and "mat", because these words are relevant to understanding "cat" in this context.

The output of the encoder looks like this (simplified vector representations):
```python
"The"  -> [0.25, 0.1, 0.7, ...]  # Contextualized vector for "The"
"cat"  -> [0.65, 0.45, 0.35, ...] # Contextualized vector for "cat"
"sits" -> [0.55, 0.9, 0.25, ...] # Contextualized vector for "sits"
"on"   -> [0.35, 0.75, 0.15, ...] # Contextualized vector for "on"
"the"  -> [0.25, 0.1, 0.7, ...]  # Contextualized vector for "the"
"mat"  -> [0.45, 0.65, 0.85, ...] # Contextualized vector for "mat"
"."    -> [0.15, 0.35, 0.45, ...] # Contextualized vector for "."
```


### 2. **Why Do We Need a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN)?**

The **self-attention mechanism** by itself is powerful because it allows the model to capture relationships between tokens, but it's still limited in its ability to capture **complex, non-linear interactions**. That's where the **feed-forward neural network (FFN)** comes in:

1.  **Non-Linearity**:
    
    -   The FFN introduces **non-linearity** into the model. Self-attention is a linear operation, meaning it combines the input in a simple, additive way. While this is useful for learning relationships between tokens, non-linear transformations (applied by FFNs) allow the model to capture more complex patterns and interactions in the data.
    -   Without non-linearity, the model would only be able to model linear relationships, which limits its expressiveness.
2.  **Token-Specific Transformation**:
    
    -   After the self-attention mechanism generates the new contextualized representation of each token, the FFN is applied **independently to each token** to further refine the representation.
    -   The FFN adds complexity and depth to the model by allowing each token's representation to undergo a non-linear transformation, helping the model capture more abstract patterns and concepts that are crucial for tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation.
3.  **Layered Refinement**:
    
    -   The Transformer is built with **multiple layers**, and each layer refines the representations produced by the previous one. The self-attention mechanism is responsible for making the tokens aware of each other, while the FFN adds complexity and expressiveness to those contextualized representations.
    -   Each layer of the encoder or decoder consists of self-attention followed by an FFN. Together, they work in tandem to incrementally improve the token representations across layers.

Let’s walk through a simple example to illustrate how the **self-attention mechanism** works and how it computes **attention scores** and uses them to output a **weighted sum** of the representations of other words in the sequence.

### Example Sentence:

Let’s take a simple sentence:

**"The cat sat on the mat."**

Each word in the sentence will be represented as a vector (embedding), and the self-attention mechanism will compute how much attention each word should pay to every other word.

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough of Self-Attention:

1.  **Input Representation**:
    
    -   Assume that each word in the sentence is first converted into an **embedding vector**.
    -   For simplicity, let's represent these word embeddings as vectors of just 3 dimensions (in reality, they are much larger, e.g., 512 or 768 dimensions).
    
```css
"The"  -> [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
"cat"  -> [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
"sat"  -> [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
"on"   -> [0.5, 0.5, 0.0]
"the"  -> [0.5, 0.0, 0.5]
"mat"  -> [0.0, 0.5, 0.5]
```
-   These vectors represent the **initial word embeddings**.
    
-   **Query, Key, and Value Vectors**:
    
    -   For each word, we generate **query (Q)**, **key (K)**, and **value (V)** vectors by multiplying the embedding by learned weight matrices $W_Q$​, $W_K$​, and $W_V$.
    -   For simplicity, let’s assume we’ve already computed the query, key, and value vectors for the word "cat":
    
```python
Query for "cat"  -> [1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
Key for "cat"    -> [1.0, 0.5, 0.0]
Value for "cat"  -> [0.0, 1.0, 0.5]
```

-   This process is done for every word in the sentence, generating different Q, K, and V vectors for each word.
    
3.  **Computing Attention Scores**:
    
    -   The **attention score** between two words is computed as the **dot product** of the query vector of the current word (in this case, "cat") with the key vector of every other word (including itself).
    
    The dot product measures the similarity between two vectors—higher scores mean greater similarity or relevance.
    
    Let's compute the attention scores for "cat" with every other word in the sentence:
```css
Attention score (cat, The)  = Q(cat) · K(The)  = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0] · [1.0, 0.0, 0.0] = 1.0
Attention score (cat, cat)  = Q(cat) · K(cat)  = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0] · [1.0, 0.5, 0.0] = 1.0
Attention score (cat, sat)  = Q(cat) · K(sat)  = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0] · [0.0, 0.0, 1.0] = 1.0
Attention score (cat, on)   = Q(cat) · K(on)   = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0] · [0.5, 0.5, 0.0] = 0.5
Attention score (cat, the)  = Q(cat) · K(the)  = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0] · [0.5, 0.0, 0.5] = 1.0
Attention score (cat, mat)  = Q(cat) · K(mat)  = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0] · [0.0, 0.5, 0.5] = 0.5
```
-   These attention scores measure how much "cat" should attend to (or focus on) each of the other words, including itself.
    
4.   **Normalizing the Attention Scores (Softmax)**:
    
  -  The attention scores are then **normalized** using a softmax function, which converts them into probabilities that sum to 1. The softmax highlights the most relevant words, while reducing the influence of less relevant words.
    
 The softmax for "cat" looks like this:
 ```python
 Softmax(attention scores for "cat"):
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5] -> [0.217, 0.217, 0.217, 0.132, 0.217, 0.132]
```
-   After softmax, the attention scores become weights, indicating how much attention "cat" should pay to each word. These values now sum to 1.
    
5.  **Weighted Sum of Value Vectors(Element-Wise Calculation)**:

The attention weights are applied to each dimension of the value vectors **separately**.

For each dimension of the vectors, the weighted sum is calculated like this:

-   For the **1st dimension** (the first number in each value vector)::
    
    -   The final step is to compute the **weighted sum of the value vectors** of the other words, using the softmaxed attention scores as weights.
        
    -   For "cat," we now use the normalized attention weights to combine the value vectors from the words "The," "cat," "sat," "on," "the," and "mat."
        
    
    Let's compute the weighted sum of the value vectors for "cat":

The attention weights are applied to each dimension of the value vectors **separately**.

For each dimension of the vectors, the weighted sum is calculated like this:

-   For the **1st dimension** (the first number in each value vector):

```python
Weighted sum for 1st dimension = 
0.217 * 1.0 (V(The)[0]) + 0.217 * 0.0 (V(cat)[0]) + 0.217 * 0.0 (V(sat)[0]) + 
0.132 * 0.5 (V(on)[0]) + 0.217 * 0.5 (V(the)[0]) + 0.132 * 0.0 (V(mat)[0])

= 0.217 + 0 + 0 + 0.066 + 0.108 + 0
= 0.391
```
```python
Weighted sum for 2nd dimension = 
0.217 * 0.0 (V(The)[1]) + 0.217 * 1.0 (V(cat)[1]) + 0.217 * 0.0 (V(sat)[1]) + 
0.132 * 0.5 (V(on)[1]) + 0.217 * 0.0 (V(the)[1]) + 0.132 * 0.5 (V(mat)[1])

= 0 + 0.217 + 0 + 0.066 + 0 + 0.066
= 0.349
```
For the **3rd dimension** (the third number in each value vector):
```python
Weighted sum for 3rd dimension = 
0.217 * 0.0 (V(The)[2]) + 0.217 * 0.5 (V(cat)[2]) + 0.217 * 1.0 (V(sat)[2]) + 
0.132 * 0.0 (V(on)[2]) + 0.217 * 0.5 (V(the)[2]) + 0.132 * 0.5 (V(mat)[2])

= 0 + 0.108 + 0.217 + 0 + 0.108 + 0.066
= 0.499
```

This vector `[0.391, 0.349, 0.499]` is the **new representation for "cat"** after self-attention. It contains information from the word "cat" itself and the other words in the sentence, weighted by their relevance.

### Why is the Final Output a Vector?

-   The final result is a **vector** because each word's representation is multi-dimensional (3 dimensions in our simplified example, but in reality, it could be 512 or 768 dimensions).
-   The self-attention mechanism computes a **weighted combination of the value vectors**, which are also vectors, so the result is a vector that has the same number of dimensions as the value vectors.
