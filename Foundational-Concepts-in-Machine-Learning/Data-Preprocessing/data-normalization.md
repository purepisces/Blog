Data preprocessing is an important step in preparing data for machine learning, especially when features (individual values within the data, like pixels in an image) vary widely in scale or distribution. One common technique in preprocessing is **normalization**, where we adjust features to have a **zero mean and unit variance**. This standardizes the data, making it easier for some algorithms to learn and perform better.

In many cases, **normalizing features** ensures that they are on a similar scale, which helps models interpret the data consistently across different features. For instance, if one feature has values between 0 and 1, while another ranges between 0 and 1000, this disparity can cause issues for some algorithms.
