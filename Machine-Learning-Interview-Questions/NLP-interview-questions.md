## Question 1

**What is NLP?**

NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. The subfield of Artificial intelligence and computational linguistics deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves developing algorithms, models, and techniques to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate natural languages in the same way as a human does.

NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks, including language translation, sentiment analysis, text categorization, information extraction, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. NLP allows computers to extract meaning, develop insights, and communicate with humans in a more natural and intelligent manner by processing and analyzing textual input.


## Question 2

**What are the main challenges in NLP?**

The complexity and variety of human language create numerous difficult problems for the study of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The primary challenges in NLP are as follows:

- Semantics and Meaning: It is a difficult undertaking to accurately capture the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences. The semantics of the language, including word sense disambiguation, metaphorical language, idioms, and other linguistic phenomena, must be accurately represented and understood by NLP models.
- Ambiguity: Language is ambiguous by nature, with words and phrases sometimes having several meanings depending on context. Accurately resolving this ambiguity is a major difficulty for NLP systems.
- Contextual Understanding: Context is frequently used to interpret language. For NLP models to accurately interpret and produce meaningful replies, the context must be understood and used. Contextual difficulties include, for instance, comprehending referential statements and resolving pronouns to their antecedents.
- Language Diversity: NLP must deal with the worldâ€™s wide variety of languages and dialects, each with its own distinctive linguistic traits, lexicon, and grammar. The lack of resources and knowledge of low-resource languages complicates matters.
- Data Limitations and Bias: The availability of high-quality labelled data for training NLP models can be limited, especially for specific areas or languages. Furthermore, biases in training data might impair model performance and fairness, necessitating careful consideration and mitigation.
- Real-world Understanding: NLP models often fail to understand real-world knowledge and common sense, which humans are born with. Capturing and implementing this knowledge into NLP systems is a continuous problem.

## Question 4

**What do you mean by Corpus in NLP?**

In NLP, a [corpus](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp-wordlist-corpus) is a huge collection of texts or documents. It is a structured dataset that acts as a sample of a specific language, domain, or issue. A corpus can include a variety of texts, including books, essays, web pages, and social media posts. Corpora are frequently developed and curated for specific research or NLP objectives. They serve as a foundation for developing language models, undertaking linguistic analysis, and gaining insights into language usage and patterns.
