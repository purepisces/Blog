## Question 1

**What is NLP?**

NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. The subfield of Artificial intelligence and computational linguistics deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. It involves developing algorithms, models, and techniques to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate natural languages in the same way as a human does.

NLP encompasses a wide range of tasks, including language translation, sentiment analysis, text categorization, information extraction, speech recognition, and natural language understanding. NLP allows computers to extract meaning, develop insights, and communicate with humans in a more natural and intelligent manner by processing and analyzing textual input.


## ðŸŒŸ Question 20

**What techniques are used to find resemblance in the recommendation system?**

Cosine and Pearson Correlation are techniques used to find resemblance in recommendation systems. Where the Pearson correlation coefficient is the covariance between two vectors divided by their standard deviation, Cosine, on the other hand, is used for measuring the similarity between two vectors.
