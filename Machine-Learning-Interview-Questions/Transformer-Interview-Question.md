## Question 1

**What is the principle of Transformer (Significant difference from other model architecture like CNN or RNN)?**


The significant difference between the Transformer model and other architectures like RNNs and CNNs lies in its use of self-attention mechanisms instead of recurrence or convolution. This allows the Transformer to process all input tokens simultaneously, enabling parallelization, handling long-range dependencies more effectively, and improving efficiency for large datasets. Additionally, the Transformer does not rely on the sequential order of data, which makes it more scalable and faster for training large models, particularly in NLP tasks.

> **Recurrence** in the context of neural networks, particularly in **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, refers to the process by which the output of a given step (or time step) in a sequence is used as input to the next step. In other words, recurrence involves feeding back the information from previous computations to influence the current computation.

## Question 2

**Why does the Transformer use positional encoding?**

The Transformer uses positional encoding to provide information about the relative positions of tokens in a sequence since it does not inherently capture order due to its parallel processing nature. Positional encoding allows the model to distinguish between different positions in the input sequence, enabling it to understand the order of words, which is crucial for tasks like language modeling and translation. Without positional encoding, the Transformer would treat input tokens as a bag of words, losing essential sequence information.

## Question 3

**Why does the Transformer use Multi-head Attention?**

  

The Transformer uses Multi-head Attention to capture different types of relationships and patterns in the input data. By applying multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, each with its own learned weight matrices, the model can focus on various parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This allows it to gather diverse contextual information and enhances its ability to represent complex dependencies in the data. Multi-head Attention improves the model's expressiveness and performance by combining these multiple perspectives before feeding the output into subsequent layers.

> -   **$W_Q$ (Query weight matrix)** – Projects the input into a "query" vector space.
> -   **$W_K$ (Key weight matrix)** – Projects the input into a "key" vector space.
> -   **$W_V$ (Value weight matrix)** – Projects the input into a "value" vector space.

## Question 4

**Why does the Transformer scale the attention score before softmax?**

The Transformer scales the attention scores before applying softmax to stabilize the gradients and improve training performance. Specifically, the attention scores are divided by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors, $\sqrt{d_k}$​​. Without this scaling, the dot products of the query and key vectors could result in large values, leading to very small gradients after applying softmax, which would slow down convergence and make optimization difficult. Scaling ensures that the attention distribution remains balanced and the model trains more effectively.

> $$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)V$$

  
## Question 5

**Why does the Transformer use different weight matrices to create Q, K and V?**

The Transformer uses different weight matrices to create the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors to enable the model to learn and capture different aspects of the input data for each component of the attention mechanism. Each of these vectors serves a distinct role: the Query determines what information to focus on, the Key represents the content of the input, and the Value holds the actual information to be aggregated. Using separate weight matrices allows the model to flexibly learn different transformations and relationships among the input data, improving its ability to capture complex dependencies and context.

  
## Question 6

**Introduce residual connections in Transformer and their significance.**

The answer is misleading for activation function part:

Residual connections in the Transformer model involve adding the input of a layer directly to its output before applying the activation function. This mechanism helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the model to train deeper networks more effectively. By ensuring that gradients can flow through the network without diminishing, residual connections facilitate better learning and convergence. They also help preserve information from earlier layers, enabling the model to combine both shallow and deep representations, which enhances overall performance and stability during training.

  
## Question 7

**Introducing LayerNorm and BatchNorm.**

Layer Normalization (LayerNorm) and Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) are techniques used to stabilize and accelerate neural network training by normalizing activations.

LayerNorm normalizes the activations across the features (i.e., all neurons in a layer) for each input independently. It is typically used in Transformer models, where maintaining the order of inputs is crucial, and it works well with variable-length sequences.

BatchNorm normalizes activations across a batch of inputs, maintaining the mean and variance of the data. It is effective in convolutional and fully connected networks but less suitable for sequential models with varying lengths.

LayerNorm is preferred in models like Transformers, while BatchNorm is common in CNNs and feedforward networks.

## Question 8

**Why does the transformer block use LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm?**

The Transformer block uses LayerNorm instead of BatchNorm because LayerNorm is better suited for handling variable-length sequences and maintaining the order of inputs, which is crucial in sequence-based models like Transformers. Unlike BatchNorm, which normalizes across a batch of inputs and depends on batch statistics, LayerNorm normalizes across the features within a single input, making it independent of batch size and more stable when dealing with diverse and variable-length data, as commonly found in natural language processing tasks. This independence from batch size and order sensitivity makes LayerNorm a better fit for Transformer architectures.

  
## Question 9

** What are the aspects of Transformer parallelization?**

Transformer parallelization is achieved through several key aspects:

-   Self-Attention Mechanism: Unlike RNNs, where computations are sequential, the self-attention mechanism in Transformers processes all tokens simultaneously, allowing for parallel computation of attention scores.

-   Positional Encoding: Since positional information is encoded directly, the model doesn't rely on sequential processing, enabling parallel processing of input sequences.
    
-   Multi-Head Attention: Each head in multi-head attention operates independently, allowing for parallelization across multiple heads, which are then combined.
   
-   Feed-Forward Layers: These layers are applied independently to each position, enabling further parallelization.
    

## Question 10

**What are the differences between Transformer Encoder and Decoder?**

The Transformer Encoder and Decoder have distinct roles and structural differences:

1.  Purpose:
    
-   Encoder: Encodes the input sequence into a continuous representation. It's typically used in tasks like classification or translation as the first stage.
    
-   Decoder: Generates the output sequence from the encoded representation, often used in tasks like machine translation or text generation.
    
2.  Structure:
    
-   Encoder: Composed of multiple identical layers, each containing a self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network, both followed by LayerNorm and residual connections.
    
-   Decoder: Contains similar layers but includes an additional cross-attention mechanism. This mechanism allows the Decoder to attend to the entire encoded sequence, alongside self-attention for generating the output.
    
3.  Self-Attention:
    
-   Encoder: Uses standard self-attention, which allows it to attend to all positions in the input sequence.
    
-   Decoder: Uses masked self-attention, which prevents attending to future tokens, ensuring that predictions depend only on the known outputs.
    
## Question 11

**What is multi-head attention?**

Multi-head attention is a mechanism in the Transformer model that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. It involves applying the self-attention process multiple times in parallel, with each instance using different learned weight matrices to generate distinct Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors. Each of these parallel attention "heads" captures different types of relationships or patterns in the data. The outputs of these multiple attention heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output, enabling the model to gather diverse contextual information and improve its overall performance.

## Question 12

**A brief introduction to Transformer's position encoding, its pros and cons**

The Transformer's positional encoding is a technique used to inject information about the position of each token in a sequence into the model, since the model itself does not inherently capture positional information. The encoding is based on sinusoidal functions, which are added to the input embeddings.

Pros:

-   Sinusoidal encoding provides a fixed pattern that the model can generalize across different sequence lengths.
    
Cons:

-   May be less adaptable compared to learned positional encodings, limiting its ability to capture more nuanced positional relationships.
    
## Question 13

** Introduce the Transformer Encoder**

The Transformer Encoder is a key component of the Transformer architecture, responsible for converting an input sequence into a rich, continuous representation. It consists of multiple identical layers, each containing two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. Layer normalization and residual connections are applied after each sub-layer to stabilize training and improve gradient flow. The self-attention mechanism allows the encoder to capture dependencies between all tokens in the sequence, enabling it to understand context and relationships effectively. The encoded output is then used by the decoder for generating the final sequence output.

## Question 14

**Introduce the Transformer Decoder**

The Transformer Decoder is designed to generate an output sequence from the encoded input representation provided by the Transformer Encoder. It consists of multiple identical layers, each with three key sub-layers: masked multi-head self-attention, which ensures that each position in the output sequence can only attend to earlier positions; multi-head cross-attention, which attends to the encoder's output to incorporate information from the input sequence; and a feed-forward neural network. Like the encoder, the decoder uses residual connections and layer normalization. The decoder's output is then passed through a linear layer and softmax to produce the final predictions.

  
## Question 15

**Introduce the Transformer Model architecture.**

The Transformer model is a deep learning architecture designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, particularly in natural language processing. It consists of an Encoder-Decoder structure, with both the encoder and decoder composed of multiple identical layers. The Encoder encodes the input sequence into continuous representations using self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. The Decoder generates the output sequence by attending to both the encoder's output and previously generated tokens, using masked self-attention, cross-attention, and feed-forward layers. The model's key innovations are its use of self-attention, which allows for parallelization, and positional encoding, which provides sequence order information.

Question The attention matrix's size 

In a Transformer model, the attention matrix's size is n×n, where n is the length of the input sequence (i.e., the number of tokens). Each element in this matrix represents the attention score between two tokens in the sequence, computed by taking the dot product of the query and key vectors for those tokens. These raw scores are then scaled and passed through a softmax function, converting them into attention weights (probabilities) that sum to 1 across each row. Thus, the attention matrix contains the weights that indicate how much each token should focus on every other token in the sequence.

question: what is q, k and v? and what's their dimension? is each word or token has a q, k and v? 

answer not sure:

In a Transformer model, each token in the input sequence is associated with three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). The query vector represents the token's request for information (which tokens it should attend to), the key vector represents how important each token is to the current query, and the value vector contains the actual information passed between tokens. These vectors are created by applying learned linear transformations to the token embeddings. Each token has its own Q and K vectors with a dimensionality of $d_k$​, and a V vector with a dimensionality of $d_v$​. In the case of multi-head attention, the total embedding dimension $d_{\text{embedding}}$​ is divided by the number of heads hhh, so each head operates with Q, K, and V vectors of dimensions $d_{\text{embedding}} / h$.


 **Input dimension**: (Embedding Size $(n_{tokens}, d_{model})$)

-   $n_{tokens}$​: Number of tokens in the input sequence.
-   $d_{model}$​: The dimensionality of each token’s embedding (e.g., 512 or 1024 in typical Transformer implementations).

**$W_Q$**, **$W_K$​**, and **$W_V$​**: These are linear transformation matrices that map the input embeddings into the query, key, and value vectors, respectively.

Dimensions of each weight matrix:

-   $W_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_k}$
-   $W_K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_k}$
-   $W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{model} \times d_v}$

Here:

-   $d_k$​: The dimension of the query and key vectors.
-   $d_v$​: The dimension of the value vectors.

After the input embeddings are multiplied by the weight matrices $W_Q$, $W_K$​, and $W_V$​, the resulting **query (Q)**, **key (K)**, and **value (V)** vectors have the following dimensions:

-   **Query (Q) dimension**: $(n_{tokens}, d_k)$
-   **Key (K) dimension**: $(n_{tokens}, d_k)$
-   **Value (V) dimension**: $n_{tokens}, d_v)$
___
question: what is prenorm and postnorm?

answer not sure:

In **Post-Norm**, the sequence of operations is as follows:

1.  The input is processed by a sub-layer (e.g., self-attention or feed-forward network).
2.  The **residual connection** adds the original input to the sub-layer's output.
3.  **Layer normalization** is applied **after** the residual connection.

In **Pre-Norm**, the sequence of operations is as follows:

1.  Layer normalization is applied to the input first.
2.  The normalized input is then processed by a sub-layer (e.g., self-attention or feed-forward network).
3.  The residual connection adds the original input to the sub-layer's output.
___
question: why we use layernorm but batchnorm

In a Transformer, LayerNorm is applied to each word's feature vector, rather than normalizing the entire sentence.


___
During **training**, the Transformer predicts all tokens in the target sequence (second token, third token, etc.) in **parallel**—**not one after another** like traditional models such as RNNs.

During **inference**, the Transformer model generates tokens **one after another**, in a **sequential** manner. This process is different from training, where predictions for all tokens are computed in parallel.
