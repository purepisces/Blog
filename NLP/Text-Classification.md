### What is Test Classification?

**Test Classification** refers to the process of categorizing test data into predefined labels or classes using a trained machine learning model. This approach is commonly used in supervised learning tasks, where the objective is to predict the class or category of new (unseen) data based on patterns learned from labeled training data.

#### Examples:

1.  **Spam Detection**: Classifying an email as "Spam" or "Not Spam."
2.  **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining if a product review is "Positive," "Neutral," or "Negative."
3.  **Image Recognition**: Identifying if an image contains a "Cat," "Dog," or "Bird."

The classification process typically involves the following:

1.  **Training**: A model learns from labeled data by finding patterns and relationships between features and target labels.
2.  **Testing**: The trained model is evaluated on unseen data to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.
3.  **Prediction**: Once the model is validated, it can classify new instances in real-world applications.
