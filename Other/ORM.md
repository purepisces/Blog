ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible systemsâ€”in particular, between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. It allows developers to interact with the database using the objects and classes in their preferred programming language (like Python, Java, etc.) rather than writing SQL queries directly.
