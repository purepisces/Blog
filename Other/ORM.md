ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible systems—in particular, between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. It allows developers to interact with the database using the objects and classes in their preferred programming language (like Python, Java, etc.) rather than writing SQL queries directly.

MongoDB is not an ORM: It is a NoSQL database, and because it doesn’t rely on relational models (tables, columns, rows), it doesn’t use an ORM. Instead, it uses Object-Document Mapping (ODM) tools (like Mongoose or Flask-PyMongo) to facilitate interaction between programming languages and its document-oriented data structure.

SQLAlchemy is not specific to MySQL. It is a database toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python that provides a unified interface to work with a variety of relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and others.
